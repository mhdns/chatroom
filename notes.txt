- HTTP is stateles, so every request is considered unique 
- Therefore the current request and the next request does not have connectivity
- Sessions allows for Data Persistance
- Sessions can be deployed in a few ways, through the HTTP reqs, hidden form fields and cookies
- The req will have the sessionID and if it expires the user will be logout
- Hidden form fields are forms with input with the type of hidden containing session details,
this forms will be passed from one page to another
- Cookies are small files (less than 4kb) stored in the browser, express uses this

- We will be using cookies and we require the express-session module to implement it and use connect-mongo
for express-session to communicate with mongo-db
- you will need a secret key to sign the session to ensure that it was not tampered with
